Yeeh (and i can not stress this enough) HAW!

This is a project by Colt Steele using SQL databases and developing a small web app implementing HTML, CSS, SQL, Node.js 
and various packages for this exercise.

The app can take email addresses and add them to a MySQL database as well as display and update the count using node & sql.
