# Mailing-list SQL & Node Web Application

Yeeh (and i can not stress this enough) HAW!

This is a project by Colt Steele using SQL databases and developing a small web app implementing HTML, CSS, SQL, Node.js 
and various packages for this exercise. Everything can be uploaded to cloud 9 and set to run. 

What was specifically cool was using Faker to add a lot of fake data. I wonder
how many of those fake email addresses ended up real.

The app can take email addresses and add them to a MySQL database as well as display and update the count using node & sql.
